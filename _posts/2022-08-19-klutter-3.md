title: Klutter - Getting Started in Intellij IDEA
---  

The Klutter Framework makes it possible to write a Flutter plugin for both Android
and iOS using [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html).
Instead of writing platform specific code twice in 2 languages (Swift + Kotlin),
it can be written once in Kotlin and used as a Flutter plugin. In this tutorial
we will create a new Klutter plugin project using Intellij IDEA.

# Before Getting Started
The only thing you need to have installed is Intellij. All tools, including Flutter,
are installed during the project initialization phase.
- [Install Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html)

# Install Plugin
First install the Intellij plugin: In the Intellij toolbar click on
Intellij IDEA, Preferences and go to Plugins. In the marketplace search for Klutter.
Install it and restart Intellij. Check the plugin is enabled.

**Note:** For running the example app in Intellij you will need to also install the
[Flutter plugin](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij). Just repeat the steps above for Intellij Flutter plugin.

# Create new project
Open the new project wizard: In the Intellij toolbar click on File, New, Project...
Alternatively if you are in the Welcome to Intellij screen just click on New Project.
On the left side of the pop-up menu there should be a project generator option for Klutter.
Select it after which you should see the klutter wizard screen:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buijs-dev/website/master/images/klutter_3_img_1.png" alt="Welcome to Intellij" />

Enter a name and group for your plugin. This tutorial will assume the following:
- name: intellij_idea_tutorial
- group: com.example.idea

Whatever you choose, stick to the following naming conventions:
* Name and group should start with an alphabetic character.
* Name and group should be lowercase
* Name can only contain one of:
  * alphabetic
  * numeric
  * '_'
* Group should start with an alphabetic character.
* Group can only contain one of:
  * alphabetic
  * numeric
  * '_'
  * '.'
* Group contains at least 2 parts (e.g. there is minimally 1 dot)

If the name or group is invalid you will get a warning:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buijs-dev/website/master/images/klutter_3_img_2.png" alt="Invalid name and group message" />

The BOM version is more lenient, meaning it will display a warning if the given version is unknown.
If you're certain the BOM version does exist then this warning can be ignored.
Selecting a BOM version from the dropdown box guarantees the correctness of the input, however.

By default, the latest (supported) Flutter version is selected. This Flutter
distribution will be downloaded to the Kradle cache folder, so that it 
can be reused by all Klutter projects. The selected Flutter version is stored
in the Klutter project. 

>[Kradle](https://buijs.dev/kradle-1/) is a new experimental CLI tool for working with 
> Klutter, Flutter, Gradle and Kotlin Multiplatform. 

Click on next, and you can enter a project name + location. This is the root folder
where the project will be created. If you prefer to keep the name of the root folder
and your plugin identical then just enter your plugin name for both fields.

Click create and wait for the project to be created. This will take a few minutes. The plugin
will do the following:
- Create a flutter plugin project.
- Add [klutter plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/klutter) to pubspec.yaml.
- Add [klutter_ui plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/klutter_ui) to pubspec.yaml.
- Execute klutter:producer init bom=2023.3.1.beta flutter=3.10.6.macos.arm64.
- Execute klutter:consumer init.
- Execute klutter:consumer add lib=intellij_idea_tutorial.

See the [documentation](https://github.com/buijs-dev/klutter-dart) to learn more about these flutter tasks.

# Build project
Great, with a few clicks we have generated a new klutter project! Let's verify everything works.
The project should be recognized and linked as a Gradle project automatically. If not, then
in the project view, right-click on the settings.gradle.kts file and select Link Gradle Project.

**Note:**
Sometimes the sync does not work properly the first time. If that's the case, go to the Gradle task bar,
right-click the project and select Reload Gradle project.

In a terminal run the command below. This will build the required artifacts for both Android and iOS.
Grab a coffee, it might take a while...

```shell
./kradlew build
```

If kradlew is not installed then you can use the GetKradle Task to 
import it into your project using Gradle (and then rerun build):

```shell
./gradlew klutterGetKradle
```

Alternatively you can build the platform module directly with Gradle:

```shell
./gradlew build -p "platform"
```

Make sure there are no error messages when the command is finished. 
In the root/android/klutter
folder there should now be a platform.aar file. For ios there
should be a Platform.xcframework folder in root/ios/Klutter containing
a framework for simulators and iphones.

# Run app
The project is set up and the app is build. Let's run the app
to check everything works. Open a terminal in the root folder
and run:

```shell
flutter pub get
```
This should execute pub get in both the root and root/example
folder. If not then go to root/example and do flutter pub get again.

In a terminal go to root/example/ios
and run:

```shell 
pod deintegrate
```

and:

```shell 
pod install
```

When successful then the terminal should display a message similar
to **There are 2 ... total pods installed.**

Open an Android emulator and iOS simulator. In the Intellij
project view go to root/example/lib and open the 'main.dart' file.
Select your Android emulator in the top bar and start the example
app from the main method.

Now select the iOS simulator and start the example app from the main
method.

And that's it. Congratulations on your first Klutter plugin
made with Intellij!
