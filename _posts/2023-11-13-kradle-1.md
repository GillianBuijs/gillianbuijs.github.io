title: 'Kradle: CLI Tool for Klutter'
---

Kradle is an executable tool to create a new independent [Klutter](https://github.com/buijs-dev/klutter) project.
Create a new project with the click of a button without having any frameworks installed (including Flutter).

Kradle can be used on any platform using the native executable.
Running your Gradle and/or Flutter commands through kradle
ensures you use the correct versions for these libraries. You can send commands
through kradle directly or use the interactive wizard to configure.

# Installation
A native kradle executable is added to the project workspace,
when creating a new project using the Intellij/Android Studio IDE plugin.
Simply create a new project using the project wizard.

You can also install the kradle tool from git or pub:

```shell
## Get from pub 
dart pub global activate klutter

## Get from git
dart pub global activate --source git https://github.com/buijs-dev/klutter-dart.git

## Use it globally
dart pub global run klutter:kradle
```

# Configuration
Kradle can be configured by using 2 files:
- [kradle.yaml](#kradleyaml)
- [kradle.env](#kradleenv)

Project configuration is stored in the kradle.yaml.
User (private) configuration is stored in the kradle.env.

## Kradle.yaml
The kradle.yaml is project specific and should be version-controlled and stored with your project sources.
The [compiler](https://buijs.dev/2023-05-28-klutter-5/) plugin uses the kradle.yaml as input. 

> The Klutter Compiler is introduced in version 2023.1.1.beta. This 
> blog post is updated for version 2024.1.beta.
> Check [github](https://github.com/buijs-dev/klutter) for latest version.

Full kradle.yaml example:
```yaml
bom-version: "2024.1.1.beta"
flutter-version: "3.10.6"
feature-protobuf-enabled: false
dependencies:
    klutter: "3.0.0"
    klutter_ui: "1.1.0"
    squint: "0.1.2"
```

## Kradle.env
Local or user configuration is stored in the kradle.env. Properties:
- [cache](#cache)
- [output.path](#outputpath)
- [skip.codegen](#skipcodegen)
- [protoc.url](#protocurl)

Full example:
```properties
cache=/Users/alberto/.kradle/cache/
output.path=/Users/alberto/IdeaProjects/my_plugin/platform/build/klutter
skip.codegen=false
protoc.url=https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v25.3/protoc-25.3-osx-universal_binary.zip
```

### Cache
Location where kradle will store its downloads (like Flutter).
Using the same cache location for multiple projects ensures kradle won't download the same Flutter
version multiple times.

### Output.path
Location where kradle will store project logging and other intermediate files.

### Skip.codegen
Boolean value to skip code generation phase of the [build](#build) task. 
In general this should be set to false (or omitted entirely) because the generated 
code should be kept in-line with the Kotlin platform code.

### Protoc.url
The URL used to download protoc. Protoc is required when using the protobuf feature.
> Protobuf is available since klutter 2024.1.1.beta

# Commands
- [kradle](#kradle)
- [gradle](#gradle)
- [flutter](#flutter)

## Kradle
Kradle commands:
- [add library]()
- [project build](#build)
- [project create](#create)
- [project init]()
- [clean cache](#clean)
- [get flutter](#get)

### Build
Build the iOS and Android artifacts and generate all boilerplate code.

> Build is always required to run the app on a device when changes are done in the platform module.

Example:
```shell
./kradle build
```

### Clean
Options:
- [cache](#cache)

#### Cache
Remove all files and/or folders from the kradle cache folder.
The cache folder is by default set to user.home/.kradle/cache.
It can be overwritten by setting the cache property in kradle.env.
The kradle.env is stored next to the kradlew scripts.

Default kradle.env cache setting:
```properties
cache={{system.user.home}}/.kradle/cache/
```

Example command:
```shell
./kradle clean cache
```

### Create
Create a new Klutter project.

Required arguments:
- root: The root folder of the project.
- name: The name of the project (and subsequently the Flutter plugin).
- group: The group/organisation name of the project.
- flutter: The Flutter distribution to use.

Example:
```shell
./kradle create name=my_plugin group=com.example flutter=3.10.6.macos.arm64
```

### Get
Get project dependencies and store them in the kradle cache.
Options:
- [flutter](#get-flutter)

#### Get Flutter
Get a Flutter distribution which is compatible with Klutter.
Option value is required to be the distribution to download 
in format major.minor.patch.platform.architecture.

Example command:
```shell
./kradle get flutter=3.10.6.windows.x64
```

##### Overwrite
Use the overwrite option to overwrite any existing distribution if present.

Example which overwrites any existing distribution:
```shell
./kradle get flutter=3.10.6.windows.x64 overwrite=true
```

## Gradle
Gradle commands can be executed by using the gradle argument.

```shell
# Run gradle clean build in the folder /platform.
./kradle gradle clean build -p "platform"
```

## Flutter
Flutter commands can be executed by using the flutter argument.

```shell
# Run flutter doctor command.
./kradle flutter doctor
```

# Wizard
When no argument is given then the interactive wizard is started.

```shell
./kradle
```
