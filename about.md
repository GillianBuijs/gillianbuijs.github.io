I am Gillian Buijs, a Software Developer based in The Netherlands. I love building software. Frontend, backend, mobile... Do you need help on your project? Or do you want to kickstart your startup? Let's talk, I got you covered! 

### My background

I started out as a Software Tester when I was 18. Manual testing was not something I enjoyed much so I soon moved to automated testing. I enjoyed creating solutions to make testing easier, more efficient. After a few years of that and performance testing, I really had the desire to do more, create more. I already knew how to code due to my test automation experience so I started working as a freelance software developer. Fast-forward to 2021 and I still love developing software as much as I did back then!

## What can I do for you?
* Freelance project work (remote or on-location)
* Setup the technical environment of your startup
* Build an app for you, iOS and Android
* Performance test your app
* And so much more...!

## Tools I love:
* Backend development with Java or Dart
* Frontend development with Angular
* Mobile development with Flutter or Kotlin
* Performance Testing with Gatling or JMeter
