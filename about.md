### My background

<p>I started out as a Software Tester when I was 18. Manual testing was not something I enjoyed much 
so I soon moved to automated testing. I enjoyed creating solutions to make testing easier, more efficient. </p> 
<p>After a few years of that and performance testing, I really had the desire to do more, create more. 
I already knew how to code due to my test automation experience so I started working as a 
freelance software developer. </p> <p> In 2021 I decided to do more mobile development.</p>

### What can I do for you?
* Freelance project work (remote or on-location)
