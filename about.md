### My background

<p>I started out as a Software Tester when I was 18. Manual testing was not something I enjoyed much so I soon moved to automated testing. I enjoyed creating solutions to make testing easier, more efficient. </p> <p>After a few years of that and performance testing, I really had the desire to do more, create more. I already knew how to code due to my test automation experience so I started working as a freelance software developer. </p> <p> In 2021 I decided to do more mobile development. My first personal project is now available in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Buijs+Software&hl=en_GB&gl=US">playstore</a> with more coming in the near future!</p>
